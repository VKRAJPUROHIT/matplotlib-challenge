This is my pymaceuticals homework

In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth are treated through a variety of drug regimens. 

Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. 

I have generated all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the study. 

The key inferences or observations are listed at the top for executive team's review


Thank you
